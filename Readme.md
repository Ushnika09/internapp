# 💸 Fundsy – Intern Fundraising Dashboard

**Fundsy** is a modern fundraising intern dashboard built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It simulates the experience of an intern tracking donations, sharing referral codes, and unlocking rewards — developed as part of the **She Can Foundation** internship selection process.
